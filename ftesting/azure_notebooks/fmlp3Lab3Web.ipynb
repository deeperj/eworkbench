In today's session we will look at the next library we shall be referencing throughout this course.  This is the scikit-learn library.  This is the major library in python used for data analytics and machine learning. \n",

We were able to use the LDA algorithm and one feature (i.e. the petal width) to perform some form of classification.  Also based on information from plots of the dataset we are not sure if the petal width is the best feature used for discrimination.  In today's session, we will implement the last session's challenge and at the same time perform data cleaning and feature engineering.  We start by importing all the necessary libraries and with the class definition we started upon in the last lab session.  The first thing will be to implement a single variable LDA and in the second case we will implement the multivariable case and finally the generic case that can morph into whatever instance is required which in OOP is referred to as object polymorphism or the inheritance case."

    "In this example we shall be adopting the Scikit-learn convention for implementing machine learning algorithms through their machine learning pipeline.  In this paradigm, we accept the process of getting results from the data will include an overall 2-step process\n",
    "1. Train the data:  This is actually more tha two steps because we assume that the data has been cleaned and feature engineered.  However once this is done, the training process creates the model we will be using to get the outputs.\n",
    "2. Fitting the data:  Once the model is ready, we can then use the model to perform data analysis which would either be a classification or regression analysis.\n",

These steps include tasks like results and model evaluation and going live.  None the less the core steps in machine learning involve these two steps of Training and fitting data.\n",

You need to forgive them for the slight mix up in the terminology but it does follow logically if you think about it deeply.  That is both in model training and model application we are trying to perform one type of fit of one thing against the other.  In training we are fitting the model to the data, while in the model application stage we are trying to see where the data fits given the model.  So to remove that ambiguity they decided to give it the name classify so it doesn't conflict with the previous fit operation.  I guess they may have decided to call the two operations Model.train() and Model.apply() but there you go.  But let us get back on track.

    "\n",
    "The good thing about the LDA algorithm we rigorously implemented is the fact that it can handle labels as text.  Not all machine learning algorithms have the ability to do this.  For instance logistic regression maps the output to zero or one and therefore labels need to be encoded in order to perform logistic classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as processing textual information as numerical data in machine learning is concerned, there are two major techniques for achieving this:\n",
    "1. Using categorical information\n",
    "2. Using one-hot encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss the two methods, however in practice it is safe to say that one-hot encoding is by far more common and natural to use even though quite counter intuitive. The one hot encoding also has a disadvantage of encouraging data sparsity which is in practice is memory expensive.  While categorical data assigns a positive integer to each feature type in the data column, one hot encoding creates extra columns for each data type in the data column and assigns a binary value of one where the feature class exists and zero on every other row.\n",

We can see here that the discrimination is still not perfect especially as two classes pretty much intermingle within each other. In the next section, we examine other important data cleaning operations.  This includes how we can produce some of these plots above, dealing with inconsistent data and most importantly the importance of dividing up the dataset into various samples for training and testing."

    "The challenge for this session introduces a Spanish Corpus of text.  This is simply a large collection of text in Spanish.  In this laboratory session challenge we are going to do some Natural Language Processing NLP.  In particular our goal today's laboratory session challenge is to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the body of text.  That is, for each word found in the text, we wish to identify if the word is a Named Entity.  A Named Entity is simply A noun that can be a person's name or a named location. The classes we wish to identify in this exercise include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we use Logistic regression for this task?   The first thing to do is to tokenize the body of text into individual words and sentences; and because we are performing a supervised learning task, we need to perform a manual categorisation of each task into the classes given above. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then aggregate our findings into a table.  This preprocessing table has already been provided for us in a regular csv file.  In addition, some additional features were added into the mix to see if the logistic regression can perform better with the extra features added.  The features given in the dataset is described as follows:\n",

However, we recall that logistic regression only takes numeric inputs.  Thankfully, we have our one-hot-encoding tool and Machine learning pipeline at our disposal to perform this task.  We will therefore perform prepocessing of this dataset using the Machine learning pipeline including the one-hot encoding and then test our dataset using the Logistic Regression class of the Scikit-Learn Library we examined earlier.  Note that we only need to one-hot-encode the inputs because the Logistic Regression class of the Scikit-learn library takes care of encoding the labels internally for us.\n",

    "The above implementation of using one-hot encoding is known as the bag of words model.  There exists another model in which rather than treating words as independent entities, in the bag we try to establish relationships between them.  A particular model or class of models is called the Vord2Vector model.\n",

    "This model performs a form of encoding called a word embedding by mapping or learning a vector representation of words in context to other words.  This can be learned through various means see (Mikolov et. al, 2013).  In the next class we will see how Logistic regression can be use to discover these word vectors. One way to think of this model is using a co-occurrence matrix decomposition. Appendix 1 explains this co-occurrence model in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this session challenge we will use a word2vec library to discover the word embeddings for our corpus. The results of this word2vec transformation will now be fed into our initial model instead of the original one-hot encoded vector and accuracies shall be compared using cross validation we considered in this laboratory session."
